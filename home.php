						<h3>Student Brochure</h3>
						<p>The Nigeria French Language Village is an Inter-University Centre for French Language Studies, located along the Lagos-Seme highway, in the coastal and historical city of Badagry.
						<span id="dots"></span><span id="more"><br>The Village is located in Ajara-Badagry, about 50 kilometres away from Lagos. Indeed the French Village is 15 kilometres to Seme, the border town between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Benin Republic. <br>The proximity of the Village to Benin Republic is an added advantage in terms of the availability of Francophone junior workers and periodic international excursions. It also offers the Village the much-needed human contacts with the francophone culture and the French Language. <br>The Nigeria French Language Village came into existence in 1992. It was established as a result of the economic recession of the 1980s in Nigeria, which made it more difficult for the country to send students of French in our Universities and Colleges of Education to Francophone countries for the mandatory French Language Immersion (year abroad) Programme. <br>In 1988, the then Federal Minister of Education, Professor Jubril Aminu, set up a Committee that was saddled with the task of carrying out feasibility studies on the establishment of Centres for the active teaching and learning of French, Arabic and Nigerian Languages. <br>His successor, Professor Babatunde Fafunwa took giant strides towards the establishment of the Nigeria French Language Village. <br>On Monday, December 16, 1991, the Government of Lagos State officially handed over to the Federal Government, the site and the infrastructures of the former “Teacher Training College”, which it had earlier renovated for that purpose. <br>On January 6, 1992, the Nigeria French Language Village received its pioneer batch of undergraduate students. The Government of Nigeria provides funds for infrastructural and Library development, as well as staff recruitment and payment of staff salaries.</span></p>

						<h3>Teaching Resources</h3>
						<p>The Nigeria French Language Village is a real language laboratory. It is a language education setting, conceived and studied to enable a natural and pragmatic learning of French.
						<span id="dots3"></span><span id="more3"><br>Generally, the Village adopts an eclectic approach to teaching. Emphasis is laid methods that aim at enabling the learners to acquire the four essential language skills: understanding, speaking, reading and writing. <br>Students acquire these four skills through interactive exercises and teaching techniques based on printed or multimedia documents that enable use of vocabulary, different registers and language codes. <br>Daily Francophone Environment, The Nigeria French Language Village recreates the conditions for a Francophone environment, which places the student in a language immersion situation. <br>Actually, majority of the Village’s workface are bilingual (French/English). Hence, students are naturally encouraged to speak French on daily basis. <br>Regular Broadcast of French Media French radio and television programmes are broadcast live almost everywhere in the Village, e.g, in the classrooms, restaurants and hostels. <br>Socio-Educative Activities formally called “Activités Socio-Educatives”, are equally one of the Ingredients of success in French language learning in the Nigeria French Language Village.</span></p>
